      <p>A programming language is a Formel Language, which
        comprises a set of instructions
        that produce various kinds of output. Programming
        languages are used in computer Programming
        to implement Algorithms.
        Most programming languages consist of instructions
        for computers.There are programmable machines
        that use a set of special instructions,rather than general
        programming languages.

        The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).
        Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard)
        while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with
        the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.
