      <h1>what is programming language?</h1>
      <p>A programming language is a Formel Language, which
        comprises a set of instructions
        that produce various kinds of output. Programming
        languages are used in computer Programming
        to implement Algorithms.
        Most programming languages consist of instructions
        for computers.There are programmable machines
        that use a set of special instructions,rather than general
        programming languages.

        A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types, how it can manipulate those types and how they interact.
        The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain
        incorrect operations. Any decidable type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs.
        In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have type loopholes, usually unchecked casts that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed
        operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to type check programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, infer types, relieving
        the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as type theory.

        The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).
        Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard)
        while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with
        the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.
