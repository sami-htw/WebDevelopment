        The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).
        Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard)
        while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with
        the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.
